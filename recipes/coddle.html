    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coddle is a staple dish from Dublin, I spent my teenage years living in Cavan and when I told people I was having coddle for dinner they would look at me as if I had 10 heads. A dish that's perfect for the winter months and always reminds me of home.</p>
    <p>Coddle is very similar to a stew. I will be honest the dish doesn't look very appealing but it's one of my all time favourites and a dish I would defend with my life!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Sausages</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausages and bacon to the Dutch oven; cook until bacon is crisp. Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings in Dutch oven; drain and discard remaining drippings. Crumble bacon; halve sausages.</li>
