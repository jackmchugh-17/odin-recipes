    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coddle is a staple dish from Dublin, I spent my teenage years living in Cavan and when I told people I was having coddle for dinner they would look at me as if I had 10 heads. A dish that's perfect for the winter months and always reminds me of home.</p>
    <p>Coddle is very similar to a stew. I will be honest the dish doesn't look very appealing but it's one of my all time favourites and dish I would defend with my life!</p>
